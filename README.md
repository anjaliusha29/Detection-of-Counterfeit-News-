# Detection of Counterfeit News using Machine Learning

## Objectives

* Build  models that can differentiate between Real news and Fake news
* Perform various text cleaning steps (Data preprocessing)
* Generate feature vectors using Doc2Vec and Word Embedding
* Classify the dataset using Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, Neural network, Long short term machine
* Find the most accurate algorithm for fake news detection

## Scope

Develop fake news detection models with different machine learning algorithms to identify  the most accurate  algorithm for classification

## Data

The datasets used for this project were drawn from Kaggle. The training dataset has about 17600 rows of data from various articles on the internet.

1. id: unique id for a news article
2. title: the title of a news article
3. author: author of the news article
4. text: the text of the article; incomplete in some cases
5. label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable
           • 1: unreliable
           • 0: reliable
